Get started quickly:

* Deploy the files to a web server. You should be able to serve it out of a subdirectory or the root directory.
* Visit index.html and it should load the example configuration.

Basic keyboard controls:
* M toggles mute
* Up / Down control channels
* Left / Right control volume

In the browser you need to un-mute when the page loads because of autoplay restrictions.

Edit the example configuration file (config.tvs.yml) and make it your own.
